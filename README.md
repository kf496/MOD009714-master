Branches  
Master - 3rd person controls of a player that can move around the room prefab.  The room prefab has a cube collider to stop the player gettin gon the floor of the room.  Contains collectable, sound, player controls via keybaord and xbox controller, obsticles with colliders.  PLayer controls could do with bieing relive to the player rather than what apears to be the room.  If you stand in the room, facing forward, controls are based on that position.  I suspect the actual player is within the Igloo Manager, which is centre to the room.    
   
Swimming - same as above, except there is a basic trench underneath the room for the player to swim through.  
   
Dogfigher - contains elements of this repo but used to control the rotation and location of the player in a unity scene.  The player in this instance is a plane under the prefab of the room.
